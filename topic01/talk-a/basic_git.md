#Git version control

A source code control system allows a devlopment team to construct a fine grained history of a project comprising a set of versions, a version being a complete copy of the project made at a specific point in the development cycle. Any particular version is retrievable at any time, a feature that helps not only the development but also the maintenance phases of the project.

Many older version control systems work with a centralized repository of the project code base. Git, however, is a fully distributed system that allows each developer to have one or more full copies of the repository and to thus be able to work offline whenever this might be a requirement.
